# The Fox Who Devoured History

In an unprecedented incident that has left museum curators both baffled and bemused, a peculiar red fox with a seemingly insatiable appetite for historical artifacts has managed to consume an entire life-sized cardboard cutout of Joan of Arc. The incident occurred late Tuesday evening at the Maritime Museum of Whimsy, where the cutout was part of a traveling exhibition titled "Warriors Through Time: A Paper Paradise."

Museum security footage captured the remarkable scene as the fox, now dubbed "Jeanne" by amused staff members, skillfully infiltrated the premises through an open window in the medieval section. The vulpine visitor demonstrated an unusually discerning palate, bypassing cardboard representations of Napoleon Bonaparte and Alexander the Great before settling on the French heroine.

"In my thirty years of museum curation, I've never seen anything quite like it," remarked Dr. Eleanor Whistledown, head curator of the Maritime Museum of Whimsy. "The fox showed remarkable precision, carefully consuming the cardboard saint from the bottom up, leaving only her iconic banner floating mysteriously in mid-air for several seconds before that too was devoured."

Witnesses report that the fox took particular care with the cutout's armor details, meticulously nibbling around the edges of each painted plate as if savoring a fine French delicacy. The creature even paused momentarily to appreciate the artistic rendering of Joan's famous sword before proceeding with its unusual feast.

Local wildlife expert Dr. James Foxworthy suggests this may be the first documented case of a fox displaying such specific historical-cultural dietary preferences. "While foxes are known to be opportunistic eaters, this particular individual seems to have developed a refined taste for French historical figures. We're currently monitoring other cultural institutions in the area for signs of similar epicurean adventures."

The museum has since increased security measures, though several staff members have advocated for commissioning a special series of historically-themed fox treats to be placed in the garden, hoping to satisfy Jeanne's apparent hunger for history through more conventional means.

The remains of the cardboard cutout—consisting of a few scattered pieces bearing traces of metallic paint—have been preserved and will be featured in an upcoming exhibition titled "Fantastic Beasts and Where They Dine: An Exploration of Unusual Art Conservation Challenges."

In a related development, local art supply stores report an inexplicable surge in fox-proof lamination requests from neighboring cultural institutions.

The fox remains at large, presumably digesting both its meal and the rich historical significance of its chosen feast. Museum staff have posted notices warning visitors to secure any portable historical replicas, particularly those depicting French medieval figures, as Jeanne may have developed a taste for the period.

When asked about potential replacement options for the consumed cutout, Dr. Whistledown smiled wryly and revealed plans to commission a bronze statue instead. "We're adapting to our unique circumstances," she explained. "Though I must admit, I'm curious to see if our furry friend would develop a taste for metalwork as well."

The Maritime Museum of Whimsy continues to operate as usual, though visitors may notice an unusual addition to the guest guidelines: "Please refrain from bringing cardboard representations of historical figures onto the premises. This includes, but is not limited to, French saints, medieval warriors, and any figure bearing a sword."
