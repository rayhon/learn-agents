This is a Vite-based project using React and TypeScript. It also includes a Cloudflare Worker, as indicated by the `wrangler.json` file and the `worker/` directory. The `src` directory contains the frontend application code, while the `worker` directory contains the Cloudflare Worker script. The project is configured with ESLint for code linting and has separate TypeScript configurations for the app, node environment and the worker.

## Codebase Analysis

The project is a simple application that demonstrates the integration of a Vite-powered React frontend with a Cloudflare Worker backend.

- **Frontend:** The React application in the `src` directory is a standard single-page application. It features a counter and a button that fetches data from a backend API.

- **Backend:** The Cloudflare Worker in `worker/index.ts` acts as a simple API server. It intercepts requests to `/api/` and returns a JSON object.

- **Integration:** The `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` is used to manage the development and build process, enabling the frontend and the worker to work together seamlessly.

- **Configuration:** The project has a well-organized structure with separate TypeScript configurations for the React app, the Node.js environment, and the Cloudflare Worker. The `wrangler.json` file is configured to support a single-page application, which is essential for client-side routing.
